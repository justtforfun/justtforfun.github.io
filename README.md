## Zombie Head! ##


Zombie heads are rolling. All you have is a few pitchforks made of bones and the Forkinator to launch them at zombies.
Make your shots count once you run out of forks consider yourself the main course!

Play [Zombie Head] (http://paulcondran.com/game-off-2012)

## Libraries Used ##

The game engine is [Cocos2D-x-html5] (http://cocos2d-x.org)

[VertexHelper] (https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/VertexHelper)  was used to create the path the zombie heads move on

[keys.css] (https://github.com/michaelhue/keyscss) for the cute keyboard styles in the instructions

[MoonWarriors] (http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/MoonWarriors_-_Cocos2d-html5_Showcase)
I used this project as a reference to get started with some of the game elements

## Sounds ##

Might be a bit late, but I have added sounds. I used Garage Band for some effects and the background music. Other sound
effects are from [freesound.org] (http://freesound.org):

* Fork shoot sound - [http://www.freesound.org/people/Erdie/sounds/65733/] (http://www.freesound.org/people/Erdie/sounds/65733/)
* Zombie Dead sound - [http://www.freesound.org/people/Rock%20Savage/sounds/81042/] (http://www.freesound.org/people/Rock%20Savage/sounds/81042/)
* Ship Dead sound - [http://www.freesound.org/people/Jace/sounds/19104/] (http://www.freesound.org/people/Jace/sounds/19104/)

I have spent a lot less time on this than I would have liked.
This meant that I had to scale back my original plans and go with something very simple but fully functional.
